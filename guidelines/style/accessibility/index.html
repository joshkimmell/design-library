High color contrast helps users who are partially or completely color blind see differences between certain colors. It creates a strong visual hierarchy and improved usability for everyone. Never rely on color as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.</p><p>undefined</p><p>undefined</p><h2 id="animation">Animation</h2><p>In addition to the fundamental visual accessibility guides, animation has its own set of considerations.
